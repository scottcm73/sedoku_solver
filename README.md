# Sedoku_solver

Standard 9 x 9 sedoku puzzles are difficult to solve. I am creating a brute force method of solving them using numpy and pandas. 



## Getting Started
I needed several solved and several unsolved sedoku puzzles of various difficulties. 

### Prerequisites

Pandas, numpy, csv file of and solved and unsolved sedoku puzzles of various difficulty levels. Zeros are converted to null as empty place holder in the 9X9 grid.

### Installing

Pipenv is used to install pandas and numpy.









## Running the tests

You have to test if it can detect whether or not a puzzle is solved. This is the part that you have to get working before you actually make functions that solve the puzzles. 



## Deployment

The first version will run in python, but eventually I may want to make a JavaScript-only version also. 

## Built With

*  Pandas, numpy
